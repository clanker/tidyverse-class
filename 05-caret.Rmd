# caret Functionality {#ch:caret}

Here is code from _Applied Predictive Modeling_ that
focuses on their R package `caret` providing functions
for statistical learning [@kuhn2013applied].

```{r}
library(MASS)
library(AppliedPredictiveModeling)
library(caret)
library(tidyverse)
apm_path <- paste('/Users/clanker/Documents/Repo16/stat-learning/',
  'apm/AppliedPredictiveModeling-master/', sep='')
# use `data("dataset")` to load data frames
```
